# firebase_device_id

Helper to get the firebase device ID to use for remote config testing.

!! This project is in progress. I've tried some of the code for Android in a separate project and got it working but I've not completed this so it's working.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter
[plug-in package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a specialized package that includes platform-specific implementation code for
Android and/or iOS.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Base documentation

This project is a wrapper of the functionality in here:
